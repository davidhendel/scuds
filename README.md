Identify halo substructure (or other linear features) using Subspace--Constrained Mean Shift

Requires Python 2.x

Depends on the 'helit/ms' subpackage https://github.com/thaines/helit

You will need to replace the ms_c.c file with the one in this repository; this allows output of the eigendirections but restricts usage to 2d (for now).
